# Computational-Analysis-of-Nipah-Virus-Glycoprotein-Using-MATLAB
As part of my Computational Biology (BT343) course project, I performed a computational analysis of the Nipah virus Glycoprotein (G) using MATLAB taking into consideration the KaKs ratio, base count and its visualization, nucleotide density, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of various strains.
