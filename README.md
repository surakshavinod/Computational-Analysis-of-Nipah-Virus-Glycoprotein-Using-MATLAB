# Computational-Analysis-of-Nipah-Virus-Glycoprotein-Using-MATLAB
As part of my Computational Biology (BT343) course project, I performed a computational analysis of the Nipah virus Glycoprotein (G) using MATLAB taking into consideration the KaKs ratio, base count and its visualization, nucleotide density, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of various strains.
Started: May 2022 Finished: May 2022
# Description
KaKs ratio tells us about the number of asynonymous substitutions to the number of synonymous substitutions that have taken place. If the KaKs ratio is less than 1, then it is a purifying selection; if then ratio is greater than 1, then it is a positive selection while if it is equal to 1, then it is a neutral selection. 
Base count and nucleotide density gives us an idea about the number of each base present in a particular protein and where the density is varying.
Multiple sequence alignment shows us the difference in the sequences between the various strains.
Phylogenetic analysis was done to establish a phylogenetic relationship.
# What I Learnt
1. This was my first time using MATLAB. Through this project, I have developed a sense of familiarity with the the MATLAb interface and working.
2. Visualisation and interpretation of theoretical learnings.
# Note
I have referred many papers and sites including matlabworks and computationalgenomics to perform this computational analysis. Huge thanks to my course professor as well.
